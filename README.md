# VLSI Physical-Design-Automation

## Introduction

This is a course on algorithms for VLSI physical design automation.
Physical design is the process of converting a circuit netlist into a geometric description (i.e., determining where to put components and how to connect them).
Topics include partitioning, floorplanning, placement, routing, and other related issues.
I took this course in Fall 2021.
