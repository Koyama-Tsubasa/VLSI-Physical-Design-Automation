# Two-way Min-cut Partitioning

Let 𝑪 be a set of cells and 𝑵 be a set of nets. Each net connects a subset of cells. The two-way min-cut partitioning problem is to partition the cell set into two groups 𝑨 and 𝑩. The cost of a two-way partitioning is measured by the cut size, which is the number of nets having cells in both groups.

* Since I did not do well in this work, I will spend some time fixing it in the future.
