# Introduction

Let 𝑪 be a set of cells and 𝑵 be a set of nets. Each net connects a subset of cells. The two-way min-cut partitioning problem is to partition the cell set into two groups 𝑨 and 𝑩. The cost of a two-way partitioning is measured by the cut size, which is the number of nets having cells in both groups. In this homework assignment, you are asked to implement FM ALGORITHM to solve the problem of two-way min-cut partitioning. Note that any form of plagiarism is strictly prohibited. If you have any problem, please contact TA.
